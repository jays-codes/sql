**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

To include diversity, equity, and inclusiveness (DEI) components in the database schema, we can add columns that capture relevant data. 

e.g. 
Employees Table
gender: To capture the gender of the employee (e.g., Male, Female, Non-binary, Prefer not to say).
ethnicity: To capture the ethnic background of the employee (e.g., Hispanic, Asian, African American, Caucasian, etc.).
disability_status: To capture whether the employee has a disability (e.g., Yes, No, Prefer not to say).
veteran_status: To capture whether the employee is a veteran (e.g., Yes, No, Prefer not to say).
age_group: To capture the age group of the employee (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, etc.).

Adding columns to capture gender, ethnicity, disability status, veteran status, and age group helps in understanding the diversity within the workforce.

Customers Table
gender: To capture the gender of the customer.
ethnicity: To capture the ethnic background of the customer.
age_group: To capture the age group of the customer.
income_level: To capture the income level of the customer (e.g., Low, Middle, High).

Adding columns to capture gender, ethnicity, age group, and income level helps in understanding the diversity of the customer base.

Vendors Table
minority_owned: To capture whether the vendor is minority-owned (e.g., Yes, No).
women_owned: To capture whether the vendor is women-owned (e.g., Yes, No).
veteran_owned: To capture whether the vendor is veteran-owned (e.g., Yes, No).

Adding columns to capture whether the vendor is minority-owned, women-owned, or veteran-owned helps in promoting equity in vendor selection.


Products Table
sustainable: To capture whether the product is sustainably sourced (e.g., Yes, No).
fair_trade: To capture whether the product is fair trade certified (e.g., Yes, No).

Adding columns to capture whether the product is sustainably sourced or fair trade certified helps in promoting ethical consumption.
